Welcome to the Business AI Research Group (BARG) GitHub repository! BARG is a dedicated and interdisciplinary team focused on addressing the myriad challenges in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. Led by Associate Professor Dr. Nik Thompson, Adjunct Research Fellow Dr. Dengya Zhu (Simon), and Dr. Michael Borck, our group brings together diverse expertise to facilitate groundbreaking research in AI.

## About BARG

At BARG, we are committed to exploring various research areas within artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on:

- AI Alignment: Investigating methods to align AI systems with human values and goals, ensuring that AI acts in ways that are beneficial and ethical.
- Safety: Addressing the safety concerns associated with AI technologies and developing robust mechanisms to prevent unintended harm.
- Robustness: Examining the vulnerabilities of AI systems and developing techniques to enhance their robustness against adversarial attacks and other forms of exploitation.
- Misuse: Identifying and mitigating potential risks of AI misuse, such as malicious use, privacy infringements, and biases in decision-making.
- Interpretability: Promoting transparency and interpretability in AI systems to enhance trust, explainability, and accountability.
- Transparency: Investigating methods to make AI systems more transparent, understandable, and accountable to users and society at large.

By conducting research in these critical aspects of AI, our goal is to ensure that the systems we create are not only capable but also ethically sound, secure, and beneficial to society.
